# uglify-hs

A binary to minify Haskell source files!

## Build requirements

You only need a stable version of the Rust compiler. Due to the use of the `?`
operator only versions 1.15 and up of `rustc` are supported.

## Install

Just call `cargo install uglify-hs` then just use the command `uglify-hs` in a project
directory to have it all minified!
